        <h1>My Health Journey 💔</h1>

        <p>This section details the significant health challenges I faced during this period, often impacting my daily life and finances.</p>

        <h2>🩺 Frequent Health Issues</h2>
        <p>Month after month, I encountered various health problems. I attributed a large part of these challenges to "witchcraft diet aspects," which made matters worse. 😔</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="emoji">🩸</span> **Blood Infection:** A recurring issue that caused much discomfort.</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">🚽</span> **Urinary Infection:** Another frequent and painful ailment.</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">🦟</span> **Malaria:** A common and debilitating illness in the region.</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">🤢</span> **Typhoid:** An severe bacterial infection that hit hard.</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">💥</span> **Gastritis:** This was the **mother of all** my health struggles, truly a persistent and draining condition.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On average, I roughly spent <span class="highlight">KSh 4,000 a month</span> on hospital visits and medication, which was a significant financial burden. 💸</p>

        <h2>😩 The Battle with Gastritis</h2>
        <p>Gastritis was by far my toughest health battle. I really struggled with it due to the lack of a proper, varied diet. My weight significantly reduced because of the limited food intake. 😔</p>
        <p>My diet was extremely restrictive, mainly consisting of: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="emoji">🍚</span> Ugali and Cabbage</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">🥬</span> Rice and Cabbage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There was practically nothing else I could eat without aggravating my condition. I spent a considerable amount of money on various medications trying to manage the pain and symptoms, but it remained a persistent and difficult struggle. 💊</p>
